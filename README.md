It's SQL project to analyze Hospital data.                                                                                                                                                                
Hospitals are vital institutions dedicated to providing basic medical care, treating a wide range of illnesses and health problems. The daily operations of a hospital involve a vast amount of information, from managing patient records and doctor schedules to tracking diagnoses and medical histories. Managing this volume of information manually is incredibly complex, inefficient and error-prone.    

This project focuses on demonstrating how database systems can significantly simplify and improve the management of critical hospital data. Hospitals interact with a vast number of individuals daily, engaging in numerous activities such as coordinating doctor appointments, recording patient conditions, and maintaining comprehensive health records.                                                     
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the benefits of using a relational database to organize and manage this complex hospital data. By storing data in a structured and efficient manner, tasks such as obtaining a complete patient history, optimizing resource allocation, or analyzing treatment outcomes become faster and more accurate. This Hospital Data Analytics SQL Project aims to build a practical and efficient system for storing, querying, and updating various types of healthcare-related data, ultimately contributing to improving hospital operations and better decision-making. 

This database contains 7 tables:

1.Physician
2.Affiliations
3.Department
4.Nurse
5.Patient
6.PatientDiagnosis
7.Procedures
